Creating an AI content checker in Python can involve different aspects, such as plagiarism detection, checking for AI-generated text, or ensuring that content quality and grammar standards are met. Here, I'll provide an example of a simple AI content checker that combines language model APIs (like OpenAI's) and text analysis tools to check for specific criteria. 

Here are the main components:

1. **Grammar and Readability Check**: Use tools like Grammarly (through their web interface or API), or a library like `language_tool_python`.
2. **Plagiarism Detection**: This often requires a paid API like Copyscape or Grammarly.
3. **AI-Generated Text Detection**: Using a language model to check for AI text probability (like OpenAI's GPT).

Here’s a Python example that combines these methods:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install language-tool-python
pip install openai
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import openai
import language_tool_python
```

### Step 3: Set Up OpenAI API Key
To access OpenAI’s API for checking for AI-generated text or quality checks, create an API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and set it up in your code.

```python
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

### Step 4: Grammar and Readability Check
Use `language_tool_python` to check for grammar and readability. 

```python
def grammar_check(text):
    tool = language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US')
    matches = tool.check(text)
    errors = [match.message for match in matches]
    return errors if errors else "No grammar issues found."
```

### Step 5: AI-Generated Content Check
You can use OpenAI’s API to generate a probability of AI-generated content by querying the API with a prompt designed to check if the text “sounds AI-generated.”

```python
def check_ai_generated_content(text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Analyze the following text and determine the likelihood it was generated by AI:\n\n{text}\n\nOutput a percentage likelihood:",
        max_tokens=50,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

### Step 6: Plagiarism Detection
While there are no free plagiarism detection APIs, Copyscape, Grammarly, and Turnitin offer paid APIs you can integrate.

### Step 7: Combine All Functions for Content Analysis

```python
def content_analysis(text):
    print("Checking grammar...")
    grammar_issues = grammar_check(text)
    print("Grammar issues:", grammar_issues)

    print("\nChecking for AI-generated likelihood...")
    ai_likelihood = check_ai_generated_content(text)
    print("AI-generated likelihood:", ai_likelihood)
    
    # For plagiarism detection, call the plagiarism API here if available

text = """Your sample content here to check."""
content_analysis(text)
```

### Notes:
- **Grammar Check**: `language_tool_python` provides grammar corrections.
- **AI-Generated Likelihood**: OpenAI's language models can analyze the style for AI-likeness.
- **Plagiarism Check**: Requires a paid service (Copyscape, Grammarly).

This setup provides basic content analysis using available tools and APIs in Python. For comprehensive use in production, using paid plagiarism APIs is recommended.
